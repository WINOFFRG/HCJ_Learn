ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **winoffrg's** Web Development asset collection. I tried my best to make everything using **HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS** only, in some cases I have also made use of latest similar helper libraries/tools.

The repository currently contains three types of assets ðŸ‘‡


 1. [Mini Projects](https://github.com/WINOFFRG/silent-lizard/tree/master/projects)
 2. [Pages](https://github.com/WINOFFRG/silent-lizard/tree/master/pages)
 3. [Components](https://github.com/WINOFFRG/silent-lizard/tree/master/components)

ðŸŒˆ Each directory has work folder related to it, with a `readme.md` file and preview URL. The file also mentions the tools/technologies used and topics/tags that were brought into use while coding.
